OVERVIEW

This document will explain the reasoning for the need to change the current financial living standards from a money driven economy, to a standard that is less stressful for everyone in the world.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GOALS

Changing the workforce payroll system from currencies to points.

Converting everyone in the world's bank account balances from dollars to points.

Evaluate what non-essential items are worth in points.

Provide all families with jobs or a career plan counselor.

Provide all families that are working, in college, or in the active military with a home, healthcare, grocery plan based on family size, a vehicle, a new SSN in a hexadecimal format, a worldwide personal ID that verifies someone's identity and income points. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SPECIFICATIONS

As long as anyone in the world is working, in school, or on active duty in some branch of the armed forces they will receive free healthcare/dental/vision/and anything related to someone's well being overall. Also, they'll receive a home based on family size, a grocery plan based on family size, a vehicle or vehicles based on family size and if approved to operate a vehicle.
Education at any level of age with guidance from a counselor if needed. And clothing and basic hygiene products. 

Everything else will be purchased with points acquired from your career.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DISASTER RECOVERY PLAN

Currently the world is losing its Ozone Layer from pollution. Instead of building an enclosed society on a different planet, why not build that enclosed society here on Earth?

We don't need to spend money on space exploration if we can create an enclosed society on Earth that can sustain life forever.

There may be other life forms within our Universe that may or may not be a threat to us. What's the point of searching and wasting money on something that's undefined, when we have problems here on Earth that are already defined?

Let's fix ourselves first, then go searching for other life forms. Also, if we have enclosed communities here on Earth it would have the possibility of removing natural disasters.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MILESTONES

Learn that our human civilization comes first.

Teach our youth to be smarter than us.

Develop new technologies and products within each market to have only one company distribute those products in each market.

Document all changes from history and present generations so that future generations know exactly why this living standard is the best solution.

Scientific research is imperative to the evolution of human beings.

Laws are needed to a certain extent, there should be a limit on how many laws can be created. The reason there are so many laws now is for the governments to generate money. If we remove the need for money, we remove 
so many factors of human downfalls.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
IN CONCLUSION

If you can't see that there's an issue with our current standards, then you're just naive to the information that has already been available to you. This doesn't mean you're stupid or dumb, it just means that nobody can know everything all the time. This world is ours and our future generations to come, let's keep it our world!
